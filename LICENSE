To use this software's code You will need to follow these rules.

(1) Credit to us, Please credit to us, e.g. link to this repo url.

(2) Add me to contributor list if it's public project (no matter OSS or not)

(3) Republic the product is only allowed If publish as build result of the repo.
Which mean in the platform that publisher must be owner of the product, you can not publish this. 
Also you have to write that you are NOT related to me on the page you publish this.
For future I publish this on some platform.

(4) exception for (3), If the product mostly modified and only use a little of codes or entire code or core are recoded, with renamed of project, you can republic it but STILL with other rules either.

SO in shortly, you are allowed to use my code in your own project however you can not just republic the software i made.
For do that you will need to add a originality on it, to make it different software than mine.
And with still credit to me and adding me on contributor list.

That's it.
